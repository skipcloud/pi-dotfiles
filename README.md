# pi-dotfiles

This is a small repo of dotfiles for use on a small device such as a raspberry pi.
A place where I don't need a full blown environment set up but just enough
configuration where life is comfortable when SSHing in.

## set up

Clone repo to `$HOME`

Make sure `stow` is installed:
* `sudo apt-get install stow`

Then run `make`
